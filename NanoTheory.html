  <div><h2>Top down approach</h2>
  <p>Size reduction techniques such as top-down or physical procedures are used to produce nanostructured material from big bulk material. The ability to synthesize huge quantities of materials is one benefit of the top down approach. However, this method makes it difficult to control shape and size. Instead of producing nanoparticles, this approach is typically useful in the synthesis of nanostructured bulk materials.
Mechanical alloying
Equal channel angular pressing
High pressure torsion
Nanofabrication and nanolithography, and so on.  </p></div>

  <div><h2>Bottom up approach</h2>
  <p>In this approach, nanostructures are assembled from the smaller starting materials such as atoms, molecules, or clusters. Short-range forces like van der Waals forces, electrostatic forces, and different interatomic or intermolecular forces cause these atoms or molecules to coalesce into nanometer-sized particles. The bottom up technique is mostly used in the chemical synthesis of nanoparticles. The key advantages of bottom up approach are the generation of a wide range of nanoparticles with very small to large scale sizes, and a more homogenous particle size distribution. Generally, bottom-up methods are most attractive for both laboratory and industrial-scale nanomaterial synthesis due to the controllability in size and properties of materials via proper control of the reaction conditions.
Some of the bottom up approaches for the synthesis of nanomaterials are:

Sol-Gel method
Physical vapor deposition
Chemical vapor deposition
Molecular beam epitaxy
Spray conversion processing
Wet chemical synthesis
Self-assembly, and so on </p></div>
